class DataRow(Entity):
    """
    Represents a row in a custom data table.
    
    For example, each response to a poll is stored as one row in a data table.
    If a poll has a question with ID 'q1', the verbatim response to that question would be
    stored in row.vars.q1, and the response code would be stored in row.vars.q1_code.
    
    Each custom variable name within a data row corresponds to a different
    column/field of the data table.
    
    Fields:
    
      - id (string, max 34 characters)
          * ID of the data row
          * Read-only
      
      - contact_id
          * ID of the contact this row is associated with (or null if not associated with any
              contact)
          * Updatable via API
      
      - from_number (string)
          * Phone number that this row is associated with (or null if not associated with any
              phone number)
          * Updatable via API
      
      - vars (dict)
          * Custom variables stored for this data row. Variable names may be up to 32 characters
              in length and can contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _.
              Values may be strings, numbers, or boolean (true/false).
              String values may be up to 4096 bytes in length when encoded as UTF-8.
              Up to 100 variables are supported per object.
              Setting a variable to null will delete the variable.
          * Updatable via API
      
      - time_created (UNIX timestamp)
          * The time this row was created in Telerivet
          * Read-only
      
      - time_updated (UNIX timestamp)
          * The time this row was last updated in Telerivet
          * Read-only
      
      - table_id
          * ID of the table this data row belongs to
          * Read-only
      
      - project_id
          * ID of the project this data row belongs to
          * Read-only
